This project holds a special place for me because it really opened my eyes to how awesome graphics programming is! Here, I programmatically define functions to compute normal vectors, and then compute the coloring for a vertex/interpolating between them to color the whole object. Note that everything in the Common folder was given to me.

To run this, open Program/canvas.html
